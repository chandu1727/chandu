Loop in C++
Loops in C++ are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. they help in manage repetitive tasks.
1.for loop: used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.
2.while loop: used when the number of iterations is not known and on a condition.
3.do-while loop: similar to while loop, but guarantees that the block of code will be executed at least once before checking the condition.
